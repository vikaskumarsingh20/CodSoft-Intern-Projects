# Landing Page:
A landing page is a beginner-friendly web development project that requires basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. It helps you learn to create columns, divide sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. Unleash your creativity to design an impressive page by paying attention to alignments, padding, color palette, and other elements. Be mindful of CSS to avoid overlapping elements and ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

# Portfolio Page:
Creating a personal portfolio using CSS and HTML is a beginner-friendly web development project. It involves adding a header section with your name or logo and a brief introduction. The about section includes an image of yourself and a short bio highlighting your skills and experience. The skills section lists your key skills, while the projects section showcases samples of your work with project titles, descriptions, and images. Additionally, you can include a resume section with a link to download your resume in PDF format, a contact section with your contact information, and a footer with a copyright notice and additional links or information.

# Calculator: 
To create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, you'll need to implement an interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The calculator should have a display screen to show user input and results. Utilize CSS grid system for button alignments. Use event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and loops to handle user input and perform calculations. This project requires some skill but can be done with basic knowledge of these technologies..
